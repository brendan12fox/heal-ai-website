# FastAPI Alternative - Full Control Over Layout

Since Streamlit is being difficult with padding, here's a FastAPI + HTML option that gives you **complete control**.

## Why FastAPI?

- **Full control** over HTML/CSS - no fighting with framework defaults
- **Much faster** than Streamlit
- **Better for production** - more scalable
- **Cleaner code** - separate frontend/backend

## Quick Setup

I can create:
1. `app_fastapi.py` - FastAPI backend
2. `templates/resource_finder.html` - Clean HTML/CSS frontend
3. `templates/perioperative.html` - Second app page
4. `static/css/style.css` - Your styling, your rules

## Estimated Time: 2-3 hours to migrate

Would you like me to:
1. **Try the minimal Streamlit version first** (just created)
2. **Build the FastAPI version** (full control, faster)
3. **Both** - keep Streamlit for now, build FastAPI as backup

Let me know and I'll build it!
